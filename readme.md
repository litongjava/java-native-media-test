Audio and Video Processing Optimization Library

[[toc]]

---

## Project Background

In traditional Java audio and video processing solutions, developers often rely on calling the FFmpeg command-line tool to meet various audio processing requirements. However, this approach has two significant drawbacks:

1. **Performance Overhead**: Calling external processes introduces additional inter-process communication overhead, which affects processing efficiency.
2. **Increased Package Size**: To ensure complete functionality, it is usually necessary to bundle the FFmpeg binary, which significantly increases the final application package size.

To address these issues, this project leverages JNI technology, allowing Java to directly call a deeply optimized C language audio and video processing library. This provides a high-performance, low-package-size audio and video processing solution tailored for specific scenarios.

## Core Features

### 1. MP3 Intelligent Splitting

#### Application Scenario

- Provides an intelligent splitting solution for large language model input file size limitations (e.g., 25MB).

#### Technical Features

- **Split by Specified Byte Size**: Enables intelligent splitting based on a user-defined chunk size.
- **Ensures Audio Integrity**: Fully considers the integrity of the audio data during splitting to ensure that each segment can be played correctly.
- **Memory-Efficient Streaming**: Employs an efficient memory streaming mechanism to optimize splitting performance and resource usage.

### 2. MP4 to MP3

#### Application Scenario

- Preprocesses video content for voice recognition by extracting the audio track from a video and converting it to MP3 format.

#### Technical Features

- **Efficient Audio Extraction**: Quickly extracts the audio track from MP4 files.
- **Preserves Audio Quality**: Retains as much of the original audio quality as possible during conversion, ensuring the output meets recognition requirements.

## Usage Examples

Below are two typical usage examples, demonstrating how to call the MP3 splitting and MP4 to MP3 functionalities.

### MP3 Splitting Example

In the test case, the `NativeMedia.splitMp3` method is invoked to perform the splitting process on a specified MP3 file.

```java
public class NativeMediaTest {

  @Test
  public void testSplitMp3() {
    String inputFile = "/audio/01.mp3";
    long splitSize = 10 * 1024 * 1024; // 10MB split

    String[] outputFiles = NativeMedia.splitMp3(inputFile, splitSize);

    for (String filePath : outputFiles) {
      System.out.println("Generated split file: " + filePath);
    }
  }
}
```

**Parameter Description**

- `inputFile`: The absolute path of the source file.
- `splitSize`: The size of each split segment (in bytes). It is recommended to set this to `25 * 1024 * 1024` to comply with large language model input file size restrictions.

### MP4 to MP3 Example

By calling the `NativeMedia.mp4ToMp3` method, an MP4 video file can be easily converted to an MP3 audio file.

```java
package com.litongjava.media;

public class Mp4ToMp3Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String inputPath = "E:\\code\\cpp\\project-ping\\native-media\\samples\\01.mp4";
    String result = NativeMedia.mp4ToMp3(inputPath);
    if (result.startsWith("Error:")) {
      System.out.println("Conversion failed: " + result);
    } else {
      System.out.println("Conversion successful! Output file: " + result);
    }
  }
}
```

## Performance Advantages

Based on practical testing and comparisons, the java-native-media solution offers the following advantages in typical scenarios:

- **40%-60% Reduction in Processing Time**: JNI call optimizations avoid the performance overhead associated with inter-process communication.
- **30% Reduction in Memory Usage**: The specialized memory streaming mechanism enhances memory efficiency.
- **Significantly Reduced Package Size**: Compared to bundling the complete FFmpeg binary, the final package size can be reduced by 85%.

## Docker Deployment

To simplify deployment and usage, this project also provides a Docker-based example. The following steps detail how to build and run the Docker container.

### 1. Add Maven Dependency

Add the following dependency to your project's `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.litongjava</groupId>
  <artifactId>java-native-media</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### 2. Create the java-native-media-test Project

Source code location:
The project includes a standalone `java-native-media-test-1.0.0.jar`, which embeds `java-native-media-1.0.0.jar`. The sample code below demonstrates how to call the MP4 to MP3 functionality via an HTTP interface:

```java
package com.litongjava.test.controller;

import java.io.File;
import com.litongjava.annotation.RequestPath;
import com.litongjava.media.NativeMedia;
import com.litongjava.tio.boot.http.TioRequestContext;
import com.litongjava.tio.http.common.HttpRequest;
import com.litongjava.tio.http.common.HttpResponse;
import com.litongjava.tio.http.common.UploadFile;
import com.litongjava.tio.http.server.util.Resps;
import com.litongjava.tio.utils.http.ContentTypeUtils;
import com.litongjava.tio.utils.hutool.FileUtil;
import com.litongjava.tio.utils.hutool.FilenameUtils;

@RequestPath("/media")
public class MediaController {

  public HttpResponse toMp3(HttpRequest request) {
    UploadFile uploadFile = request.getUploadFile("file");
    byte[] data = uploadFile.getData();
    new File("upload").mkdirs();
    File file = new File("upload", uploadFile.getName());
    FileUtil.writeBytes(data, file);
    String result = NativeMedia.mp4ToMp3(file.getAbsolutePath());
    String contentType = ContentTypeUtils.getContentType(FilenameUtils.getSuffix(result));
    byte[] fileBytes = FileUtil.readBytes(new File(result));
    HttpResponse response = TioRequestContext.getResponse();
    Resps.bytesWithContentType(response, fileBytes, contentType);
    return response;
  }
}
```

### 3. Dockerfile Example

Below is a Dockerfile example that builds a Docker image based on JDK 8, installing the necessary dependencies (such as FFmpeg and libmp3lame0):

```dockerfile
FROM litongjava/jdk:8u411-stable-slim

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y ffmpeg libmp3lame0

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the JAR file into the container
COPY target/java-native-media-test-1.0.0.jar /app/

# Run the JAR file
CMD ["java", "-jar", "java-native-media-test-1.0.0.jar"]
```

Build the image using the following command:

```bash
docker build -t litongjava/java-native-media-test:1.0.0 .
```

Example of running the image:

```bash
docker run -dit --name java-native-media-test -p 80:80 litongjava/java-native-media-test:1.0.0
```

Or run with automatic cleanup after execution:

```bash
docker run --rm --name java-native-media-test -p 80:80 litongjava/java-native-media-test:1.0.0
```

Sample runtime output:

```
os name:linux user.home:/root
load /root/lib/linux_amd64/libnative_media.so
```

Final packaged file information:

- `java-native-media-1.0.0.jar` is approximately 7.21MB.
- `java-native-media-test-1.0.0.jar` is approximately 13.6MB.
